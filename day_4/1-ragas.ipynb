    "# Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Ragas is a framework that helps you evaluate your Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines. RAG denotes a class of LLM applications that use external data to augment the LLM’s context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note: This is notebook is a remake from activities provided by AI-Makerspace when I enrolled in Cohort 2 of AI Engineering.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Evaluate\n",
    "\n",
    "Because you cannot improve what you cannot measure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluating Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is crucial because it ensures the accuracy, reliability, and contextual relevance of the generated content by retrieving pertinent information from trusted sources. This evaluation helps identify and mitigate biases, ensuring fairness in the responses. Additionally, it optimizes the model's performance, enhancing efficiency and response times, which in turn builds user trust by consistently delivering high-quality and relevant information. Overall, thorough evaluation of RAG models is essential for refining their capabilities and improving the user experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Evaluation of RAG Using Ragas\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook we'll explore how to evaluate RAG pipelines using a powerful open-source tool called \"Ragas\". This will give us tools to evaluate component-wise metrics, as well as end-to-end metrics about the performance of our RAG pipelines.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following notebook we'll complete the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Install required libraries\n",
    "  2. Set Environment Variables\n",
    "  3. Creating a simple RAG pipeline with Langchain\n",
    "  4. Synthetic Dataset Generation for Evaluation using the Ragas\n",
    "  5. Evaluating our pipeline with Ragas\n",
    "  6. Making Adjustments to our RAG Pipeline\n",
    "  7. Evaluating our Adjusted pipeline against our baseline\n",
    "  8. Testing OpenAI's Claim\n",
